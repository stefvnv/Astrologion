                "description": "The Zodiac, an ancient celestial coordinate system, is defined by twelve 30° divisions of celestial longitude centered around the Sun's apparent path through the heavens over the course of the year. These divisions correspond to twelve constellations and serve as the foundation for astrology, a tradition that dates back to Babylonian and Hellenistic cultures. The Zodiac's primary function is to link human characteristics and events to celestial occurrences, offering a unique blend of astronomy and astrology that has captivated human interest through the ages."
