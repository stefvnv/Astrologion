                "description": "Aspects in astrology refer to the angles formed between planets on the celestial sphere as viewed from Earth. These angles determine how the energies of different planets interact and influence each other, and subsequently, how they manifest in a person’s life. Aspects can be harmonious or challenging, and each type of aspect brings its unique dynamic to the astrological chart. Understanding aspects is crucial for interpreting how planetary energies combine, either reinforcing each other’s influence or creating tension that needs resolution."

                "description": "Aspects are fundamental to astrological interpretation as they provide detailed insights into the complex relationships between the planets in a birth chart. They help to clarify the underlying themes of a chart, revealing potential strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and talents. Aspects can indicate areas of life that are likely to be sources of conflict or growth, and they guide the astrologer in predicting timing and types of experiences an individual might encounter. A comprehensive interpretation of a chart without considering aspects would miss much of the nuance that gives depth to an astrological analysis."

Major aspects include conjunctions, oppositions, trines, squares, and sextiles, each offering a different flavor of interaction between planetary energies. Minor aspects, such as semisextiles, quintiles, and sesquiquadrates, while less impactful than major aspects, add further layers of complexity and detail to the chart. Each category and type of aspect has specific degrees and orb allowances that define its strength and influence in the astrological chart."
